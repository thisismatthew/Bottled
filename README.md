# Bottled

## Description
Bottled! Is a 3D puzzle platformer full of mischief and magic. Explore the home of a forgetful old witch as you control Noodles, a little potion bottle who has been brought to life. The animation magic was taxing, however, and the Witch has fallen ill. Collect ingredients to brew potions, and gain new abilities and unlock new areas. Can you create a healing potion in time to save the Witch?

## History
In February 2021 a team of 7 students came together with the goal of creating a lighthearted, accessible platforming game. The idea for the game came from a character concept- a potion bottle who gained powers based on the potion it held inside. Melbourneâ€™s second wave of lockdowns hit shortly after production began and development of Bottled! has continued remotely. The team gained its 8th member in August, and the game is set for release in November.
