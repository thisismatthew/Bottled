  - <speed=40><size=150%> Ooooooh that is delicious... don't look at me like that,
    cauldron tea is the best way to brew a cup!

    ingredient for that then... I think we'll need Will o Wisps to make a health
    potion!
  - <speed=40><size=150%> Will'O'Wisp have a cleansing effect, that should help burn
    up my slug sickness!

    haunting you while you cook!
  - <speed=40><size=150%> Go grab that jar and chuck it in the cauldron!
