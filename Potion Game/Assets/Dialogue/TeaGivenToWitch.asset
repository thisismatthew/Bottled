  - <speed=30><size=200%>Ooooooh that is delicious... don't look at me like that,
    cauldron Tea is the best way to brew a cup.
  - '<speed=40><size=300%>OH! '
  - '<speed=40><size=300%>I feel recharged! '
  - '<speed=40><size=300%>Look at me, I feel a hundred years young! '
  - <speed=40><size=300%>Oh no...
  - <speed=40><size=300%>I think I feel worse than before...
  - <speed=40><size=200%>We'll need to brew a Health Potion, I think. What was the
    ingredient for that, then... I think we'll need Will-O'- Wisps to make a Health
    Potion!
  - <speed=30><size=200%>Will-O'-Wisps have a cleansing effect, that should help
    burn away whatever is ailing me.
  - <speed=40><size=200%>You have to keep Will-O'-Wisps high up, otherwise they start
    haunting you while you cook!
  - <speed=30><size=300%>Go grab that jar and chuck it in the cauldron.
