  - <speed=30><size=200%>Wonderfu...uuh. Why is it purple... ?
  - <speed=30><size=200%>Oh no... I've done it again! That's not a Health Potion
    at all...
  - '<speed=40><size=250%>That''s a Potion of Levitation! You''ll be all floaty now.
    I brew this to imbue arcane objects with floatiness, like those books you jumped
    around on earlier. '
  - '<speed=40><size=250%>Speaking of books... If you pour that onto any of these
    blue ones that I have already started enchanting, it should cause them to levitate
    for a bit... '
  - <speed=40><size=250%>At least you can't smash now- maybe that will help us find
    the ingredient I need. But for the life of me, I can't remember what it is...
  - '<speed=30><size=200%>Oh dear, I''m going to rest my eyes for a little while... '
  - <speed=30><size=200%>Hopefully my magic doesn't leak much more....
  - <speed=30><size=250%>Otherwise your enchantment...
  - <speed=30><size=250%>Might stop...
