  - <speed=40>Wonderfu...uuh. Why is it purple... ?
  - <speed=40>Oh no... I've done it again! That's not a Health Potion at all...
  - '<speed=40>That''s a Potion of Levitation! You''ll be all floaty now. I brew
    this to imbue arcane objects with floatiness, like those books you jumped around
    on earlier. '
  - '<speed=40>Speaking of books... If you pour that onto any of these blue ones
    that I have already started enchanting, it should cause them to levitate for
    a bit... '
  - <speed=40>At least you can't smash now- maybe that will help us find the ingredient
    I need. But for the life of me, I can't remember what it is...
  - '<speed=40>Oh dear, I''m going to rest my eyes for a little while... '
  - <speed=40>Hopefully my magic doesn't leak much more....
  - <speed=40>Otherwise your enchantment...
  - <speed=40>Might stop...
