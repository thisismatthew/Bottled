  - <speed=40>Oh dear, what a mess!
  - <speed=40>That looks to be a perfectly brewed health potion! Quick come over
    here and fill my cup!

    of my magic must be leaking! That does happen when you get older, dear....
  - '<speed=40>My cute little assistant, I''m glad your enchantment still works,
    at least. Yes, you there, on the table! '
  - <speed=40>You can help me get better.
  - <speed=40>I think some Tea should be just the thing to set me right. There is
    some up there in the shelving, would you go fetch it for me?
