  - <speed=40>I enchanted those little arms of yours to be strong enough to lift
    you... even if they don't look it!
  - <speed=40>You're up so high! Be careful dear, you are made of glass after all.
    Though, I can always reenchant you if you break- I have plenty more bottles lying
    around.
  - <speed=40>Jump and grab the rope with [grab]! Don't be scared, I know you can
    do it.
