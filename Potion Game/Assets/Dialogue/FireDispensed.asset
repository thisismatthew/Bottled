  - '<speed=40><size=200%>Good thing I enchanted the cauldron to dissolve glass,
    otherwise this would be a pretty dangerous health potion. '
  - <speed=30><size=400%>Oh no...
  - <speed=30><size=300%>Thats not a health potion at all! We've brewed a Fairy Fyre
    Potion!
  - <speed=40><size=200%>Fairy Fyre is useful, though- you can pour it on arcane
    candles to light them, and you can see rune wax under its light. It's usually
    invisible, so Fairy Fyre is quite a handy little mixture! I use it for all of
    my rituals.
  - <speed=40><size=200%>Well, while I try to remember the recipe for a Health Potion,
    you could make yourself useful and burn up some of the cobwebs around here...
