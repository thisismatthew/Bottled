  - '<speed=40><size=150%>Good thing I enchanted the cauldron to dissolve glasss,
    otherwise this would be a pretty dangerous health potion. '
  - <speed=30><size=300%>Oh no
  - <speed=40><size=150%>I still have such slug brain.... thats not a health potion
    at all! We've brewed a FairyFyre Potion!
  - <speed=40><size=100%>Fairy Fyre is useful though! You can pour it on arcane candles
    to light them, and you can see rune wax under its light. I use fairy fyre for
    all my rituals.
  - <speed=40><size=100%>Well while I try to remember the recepie for a health potion....
    you could make yourself useful and burn up some of the cobwebs around here...
