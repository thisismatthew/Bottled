  - <speed=40>Oh!  I remember now- Peryton Feathers! That's the ingredient we need
    for a Health Potion!
  - <speed=40>Along with Tea and Wisps and whatever else crawled into the cauldron
    overnight...
  - <speed=40>Finish off this ritual for me by placing candles lit with Fairy Fyre
    in these circles. And this circle should summon some Peryton Feathers!
  - '<speed=40>Peryton Feathers are so light and etherial, they should float this
    forgetfulness right out of my head. '
